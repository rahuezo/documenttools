counties as well as the northern parts of Saratoga and Washington counties The district is currently the 113th and has been represented by Assemblywoman Teresa Sayward R Willsboro since 2003 Sayward will retire at year s end to spend more time with her familyDan Stec will be on the Republican Conservative and Independence party lines He is supervisor of the town of Queensbury and chairman of the Warren County Board of SupervisorsDennis Tarantino will be on the Democratic and Working Families party lines He is sole proprietor of the Kenneally and Tarantino law firm and owner of Maple Abstract and Realty Corporation both in Glens FallsBoth candidates agreed that the biggest challenge for upstate school districts is the state s formula for distributing aidOften the school aid formula favors downstate schools leaving our upstate schools with big challenges in funding a high quality education that prepares our kids for the new economy Stec said I will work to remedy the school aid formulaArticle LinksTarantino said reforms to crack down on cyberbullying and new teacher evaluation systems will have a positive impact on the state s education system but he also stressed that funneling more state aid to rural school districts is the most important step Albany can takeWe ve got to figure out this aid formula and get some more aid to the schools Tarantino said There s nothing more important than getting these kids educatedHydraulic fracturingWhile hydraulic fracturing of underground shale deposits to extract natural gas won t affect North Country communities some proponents say it will have a positive impact on the state s economy Opponents say the practice could jeopardize water qualityStec said if the state departments of Health and Environmental Conservation deem fracking safe it would be worth exploring as part of an overall economic recovery planThe decision that is ultimately made should be based on science and should respect the wishes of the local municipalities he saidTarantino said he doesn t like to be labeled as pro development or as an environmentalist He said the state is right to require expert review before moving forwardMy first reaction was as a businessman and as somebody who has represented farmers in the past it s a good thing Tarantino said Then you start to look at the rest of the story If we re going to do hydro fracking we better have in place a bond maybe a bond maybe force these companies to put up money in escrow so if that unfortunate thing happens that the environmentalists say could happen we can draw on it and fix itThat doesn t mean I m supporting hydro fracking I m going to look at it I m going to listen to both sides of the argumentSame sex marriageIn 2011 New York state passed legislation legalizing same sex marriage Some Republican lawmakers like state Sen Roy McDonald of Saratoga crossed party lines to vote for the bill McDonald paid a price for that vote losing a Sept 13 Republican primary to Saratoga City Clerk Kathy Marchione who is against same sex marriageTarantino called same sex marriage a dead issue despite the fact that it became a focal point of several Republican primary races in New York state including the race for his neighboring 115th Assembly District He declined to state whether he supports itStec said he would not have supported same sex marriage legislationI view marriage traditionally as most other New Yorkers do between one man and one woman he said With that said I recognize that this model does not work for everyone and that this question has been addressed by the state already recently However rather than redefining marriage I would suggest that virtually all rights and benefits can be provided to all by simply creating a structure to allow for civil unions as a legal status to provide the benefits most of us associate with traditional marriageAssemblywoman Teresa Sayward whose son is gay defiantly broke ranks with her party to vote for the legislation stating in March that she was proud to stand up speak out and vote in support of marriage equality for all New YorkersFound Keywords: THOSE
